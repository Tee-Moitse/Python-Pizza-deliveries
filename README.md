# Python-Pizza-deliveries
A simple pizza delivery user input prompt program


 Python Pizza deliveries is a simple Python program that I have built from the simple cooncepts of Python that I have learnt as a beginner to coding. This program takes in orders from customers and prompts user input to allow the customer to choose what pizza size they want and also what do the want the toppings provided. It also has a counter, whereby the value of the order is added up and then calculates the total bill the customer needs to pay.

 This is just a simple Python project that one can build with the fundamentals of Python.
